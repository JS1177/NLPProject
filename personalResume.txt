About Me
As an individual who has developed a strong appreciation and passion for Artificial Intelligence (AI) during my study at NYP, I have actively engaged in independent, self-directed learning. I have taught myself various programming languages and fundamental theories of AI (Probability & Calculus, etc.). Currently, I am looking to add value to an organisation by using my knowledge and expertise to develop various AI models and algorithms, as well as share these outcomes with multiple stakeholders.
